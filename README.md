Project Name: Google search interface
Description:

SearchMaster is a front-end web application designed to replicate and enhance the search experience provided by Google. This project includes three distinct pages, each tailored for different types of searches:

Google Search Page:

Features: Allows users to perform standard Google searches. Users can enter their search queries in a centered search bar with rounded corners and click on the "Google Search" button to view results. An "I'm Feeling Lucky" button is also available, redirecting users directly to the top search result.
Navigation: Links in the upper-right corner direct users to the Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search pages.
Google Image Search Page:

Features: Enables users to perform image-specific searches on Google. Users can enter their query and click a "Search" button to view image results.
Navigation: Includes a link to return to the Google Search page.
Google Advanced Search Page:

Features: Provides advanced search options with four text fields for users to specify their search criteria:
Find pages with… "all these words:"
Find pages with… "this exact word or phrase:"
Find pages with… "any of these words:"
Find pages with… "none of these words:"
Button: The "Advanced Search" button is styled in blue with white text, consistent with Google's design. Clicking this button takes users to the results page based on their advanced search criteria.
Navigation: Includes a link to return to the Google Search page.
Key Features:

User Interface: Clean and simple design mimicking Google's aesthetics, including centered and rounded search bars, and appropriately styled buttons.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.
Navigation Links: Easy access between different search functionalities, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Purpose:
The project aims to replicate Google's search interfaces while providing users with a familiar and intuitive way to perform searches, including advanced search options. This exercise demonstrates understanding of HTML forms, CSS styling, and basic navigation between web pages.
